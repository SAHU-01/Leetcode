JAVA

Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

 

Example 1:

Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
	
		// array to store the count of each letter in "magazine"
         int[] count = new int[26];
		 
        for (char ch : magazine.toCharArray()) {
            count[(int) ch - (int) 'a'] += 1;
        }
	   
	   // decrementing the count of each character to see if more are needed
        for (char ch : ransomNote.toCharArray()) {
            count[(int) ch - (int) 'a'] -= 1;
        }
    
		// if any count is negative, means there were insufficient number 
		// of that character so "ransomNote" cannot be constructed
        for (int i : count) {
            if (i < 0)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
